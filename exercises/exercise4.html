        <p>I chose Diane's picture because I loved how natural the colors were! This picture was taken on her iPhone in her backyard and is a great example of how beauty is found everywhere in nature!</p>

        <p>Peter's picture jumped at me due to the gorgeous composition and the trees reflection off the lake! This picture is much more professional than the other two and I thought it would be a great addition to my images website.</p>

        <p>I took this picture myself in October of my freshman year! It was my first real fall in Massachusetts and I remember appreciating all the gorgeous colors on campus.</p>
