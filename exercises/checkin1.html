        <h1>The Amazon Rainforest!</h1>
        <p>The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, as well as one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. The forest plays a critical role in regulating the planets climate and supports millions of species.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <p>The Amazon spans across nine South American countries, 60% of the forest is within Brazil however it also extends to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Peru</li>
            <li>Columbia</li>
            <li>Venezuela</li>
            <li>Ecuador</li>
            <li>Bolivia</li>
            <li>Guyana</li>
            <li>Suriname</li>
            <li>France (via French Guiana)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why It's Important</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Climate Regulation: The Amazon acts as lungs for the Earth, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. This helps to stabilize global temperatures and weather patterns.</li>
            <li>Biodiversity: The Amazon is home to over 40,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, more than 400 mammal species, and millions of insects.</li>
            <li>Indigenous Communities: Over 400 Indigenous groups live in the Amazon, many maintain traditional lifestyles and deep ecological knowledge of the forest.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Amazon under threat</h2>
            <p>According to <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/amazon/">WWF</a>, "transportation and energy infrastructure are essential for national and regional development, but when they are poorly planned, negative impacts can exceed short-term benefits. For example, building new roads exposes previously inaccessible areas of forest to illegal and unsustainable logging, as well as illegal or unplanned settlements and agricultural expansion."</p>
            <p>Along with the negative impacts of poorly planned infrastructure, deforestation is harmfully affecting the rainforests sutainability. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/forests/amazon-rainforest/">Green Peace</a> scientists warn that "if even only 5–8% more of the Amazon is lost to deforestation, it could reach a tipping point, meaning the rainforest will not be able to produce enough rain to sustain itself. This would have a disastrous impact on the whole world’s climate."</p>
