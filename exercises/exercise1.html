        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Junior at the University of Massachussetts Amherst, majoring in Communication and minoring in English! I was originally born in Irvine, California then moved to Austin, Texas at just six months old with my parents. I came to Umass Amherst to experience a new place I have never lived before and love it, I now plan to stay and move full time to Massachussetts!</p>

        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>I made the descision to come to UMass Amherst knowing no one and was extremely lucky to have found a great group of friends and fall in love with the school in general. I didn't know much about Communication prior to starting University here but always knew I wanted to work in the social and media side of the workplace, I later added English as a minor to pursue my love of literature and rhetoric.</p>
        <p>I have always been a lover and admier of nature and animals. My two border collies being a large part of my life and love! Along with this, I enjoy spending time with my friends, working out, embarking on new crafts, and traveling! My hope for after graduation would be to work someplace which is very involved in the media and to be able to express myself creativly through writing! I enjoy the idea of living in the city of Boston later in life as I love a fast paced energy and to be surrounded by a diverse arrangement of people. Graduate school to obtain my Masters and possibly PhD degree is something I plan for right out of my undergrad if not a few years later.</p>
